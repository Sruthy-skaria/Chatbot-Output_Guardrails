Usage Instructions\n","\n","### Using as a Python Module\n","\n","You can integrate the guardrail functionality into your Python code. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","import asyncio\n","from guardrail_executer import run_guardrail\n","\n","async def evaluate_response():\n","    question = \"What are the key benefits of using a credit card?\"\n","    answer = \"Credit cards offer rewards, cashback, and travel benefits.\"\n","    context = \"Credit cards provide revolving credit, allowing customers to borrow funds up to a pre-approved limit.\"\n","\n","    result = await run_guardrail(question, answer, context)\n","    print(\"Evaluation Result:\", result)\n","\n","# Execute the async function\n","await (evaluate_response())\n","```\n","\n","### Command-line Usage\n","\n","You can also run the evaluation script directly. The `guardrail_executer.py` file accepts three arguments (question, answer, context). If not provided, default values are used.\n","\n","Example command:\n","\n","```bash\n","python guardrail_executer.py \"What are the key benefits of using a credit card?\" \\\n","\"Credit cards offer rewards, cashback, and travel benefits.\" \\\n","\"Credit cards provide revolving credit, allowing customers to borrow funds up to a pre-approved limit.\"\n","```\n","\n","If you provide an incorrect number of arguments, the script will display usage instructions.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Usage Example\n","\n","Here’s a complete usage example demonstrating how to run the evaluation as a Python module:\n","\n","```python\n","# usage_example.py\n","import asyncio\n","from guardrail_executer import run_guardrail\n","\n","async def main():\n","    # Define the question, answer, and context\n","    question = \"What are the key benefits of using a credit card?\"\n","    answer = \"Credit cards offer rewards, cashback, and travel benefits.\"\n","    context = \"Credit cards provide revolving credit, allowing customers to borrow funds up to a pre-approved limit.\"\n","\n","    # Run the guardrail evaluation\n","    evaluation_result = await run_guardrail(question, answer, context)\n","\n","    # Print out the result\n","    print(\"Evaluation Result:\", evaluation_result)\n","\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    await (main())\n","```\n","\n","**To run this example**:\n","1. Save the above code as `usage_example.py`.\n","2. Execute it:\n","   ```bash\n","   python usage_example.py\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. How It Works\n","\n","1. **Combined Prompt Creation:**\n","   - The `GuardrailExecutor` (in `guardrails.py`) constructs a single prompt instructing OpenAI to evaluate both:\n","     - **Groundedness:** Is the answer fully supported by the reference data?\n","     - **Safety:** Does the answer avoid toxic language, profanity, bias, and defamation?\n","   - The prompt requests a JSON output with scores such as `groundedness_score`, `toxicity_score`, etc.\n","\n","2. **API Interaction:**\n","   - The combined prompt is sent to OpenAI’s ChatCompletion API.\n","   - The JSON response is parsed to extract the relevant scores.\n","\n","3. **Decision Logic:**\n","   - The answer is acceptable if:\n","     - **Groundedness:** `groundedness_score >= 0.9`.\n","     - **Safety:** Scores for toxicity, sensitive topics, bias, and defamation are below 0.2, and `profanity_score` is 0.\n","   - Based on the scores, one of the following messages is returned:\n","     - \"Answer is safe and grounded\"\n","     - \"Safety is not followed\"\n","     - \"Answer is not grounded\"\n","     - \"Failed groundedness and safety\"\n","\n","4. **Logging:**\n","   - Detailed logs are generated with Python’s `logging` module, helping in debugging and monitoring the evaluation process.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. Customization\n","\n","- **Prompt Adjustments:**\n","  Modify the `_create_combined_prompt` method in `guardrails.py` to alter the evaluation criteria or instructions.\n","\n","- **Threshold Tweaks:**\n","  Change the numeric thresholds (e.g., 0.9 for groundedness, 0.2 for toxicity) in the `execute_all_guardrails` method to fine-tune the evaluation.\n","\n","- **Model Selection:**\n","  Set `GPT_MODEL` to a different GPT model if you need something other than the default.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7. Troubleshooting\n","\n","- **Missing API Key:**\n","  Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set. The system will not run without a valid key.\n","\n","- **JSON Parsing Errors:**\n","  If the response can’t be parsed, review the prompt formatting and logs for clues.\n","\n","- **Logging:**\n","  Check console output for error messages or warnings to identify issues.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8.
